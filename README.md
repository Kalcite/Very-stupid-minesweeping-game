# Very-stupid-minesweeping-game
## A silly little game  
To play this game, you need to prepare a piece of paper and a pen, because the program will not output the location of the mine. You only know which grid corresponds to which location. There is no right click to clear the mine. You can only guess (but the basic playing method is the same as the original version)  
You need to enter the number of rows and columns to determine the position (from left to right, from top to bottom). The number corresponds to 0~7
